# Crypto4FunUIKit
In this project you'll find how I made this UIKit version of the [Crypto4Fun in SwiftUI](https://github.com/Harry-KNIGHT/Crypto4Fun-SwiftUI) and how I'm using [Crypto4FunKit](https://github.com/Harry-KNIGHT/Crypto4FunKit) on MVC project.

All the project is made in UIKit with some help of [Mickael MAS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/appiwedia/).
